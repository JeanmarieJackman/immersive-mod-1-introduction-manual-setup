# Manual Setup

Congratulations on finishing the pre-work and welcome to the program!

Now, we are going to stop utilizing the LEARN IDE! For this we have specific [instructions](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/environment-mac-os-catalina-setup) to get your local environment set up and ready.

After you've followed the instructions linked above for setting up your local environment, there are additional, optional [installation instructions here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/environment-mac-os-catalina-optional-setup) to check out.

_\*Note on STEP 0:_ 
* _If you have been using the Learn IDE that is built into your browser when you visit learn.co: IGNORE STEP 0, it does not apply._ 
* _If you have a DOWNLOADED version of the Learn IDE that opens up in Atom, follow the instructions in STEP 0_
